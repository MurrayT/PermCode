PermCode
========

Public repository for the code formerly known as PermLab. This mirrors a NetBeans 7.4 project, but the source can mostly be used without the need for NetBeans. Navigate away.

Now divided into two sets of packages

permlib - a library for the combinatorics of permutation

permlab - a gui for permutation classes

See (eventually) more details at
