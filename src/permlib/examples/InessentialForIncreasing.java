/*
 * An element in a permutation is inessential for increasing subsequences if,
 * it is LR min immediately followed by another, or a RL max immediately
 * preceded by another, or whenever it occurs as a 2 in abc there is a 1234
 * of the form axyc.
 *
 * What is the 'essential core' of a permutation? Can we do something similar
 * for other max-C problems?
 *
 * E.g. for a max 132 - the 3 must be the top of a peak.
