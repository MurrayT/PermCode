            <p>
                The <i>animation window</i> allows you to view an animation
                of a selection of permutations.

            <p>
                An animation window must be initialised with a supply of 
                permutations, usually from another element of <i>PermLab</i>.
                For instance, the class window can generate animations, or 
                a text window can be used to load a file and then animate the
                permutations it contains.
            </p>
            <p>
                The controls are straightforward with a slider controlling the
                speed of the animation, various buttons that control the animation
                running, and a text field allowing direct entry of a frame number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <i>Sort</i> button sorts the background collection of permutations
                by length, and then lexicographically within length. This is sometimes
                useful to produce a more structured view of the collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a right-click menu available in the main display area which
                allows the current permutation, or all the permutations of this movie
                to be shown as text. The <i>Show as PSTricks</i> option is not currently
                functional.
