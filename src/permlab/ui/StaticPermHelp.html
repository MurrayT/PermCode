                This window allows for the graphical exploration of permutations.

            <ul>
                <li>
                Type a permutation in the <i>Permutation</i> field, or build
                one by clicking in the large upper window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Right click in the upper window to get appropriate menus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restrict to permutations not containing certain patterns
                    by entering permutations in the <i>Basis</i> area and
                    clicking <i>Ok</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restrict to simple permutations by selecting the check box.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Illustrate the monotone and singleton constraints implied
                    by the restrictions by selecting the check box. This action
                    is <strong>not</strong> recorded in the history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Move forward and backward through your construction by using
                    the arrows (which function like the forward and back buttons
                    in a browser.)
                </li>
