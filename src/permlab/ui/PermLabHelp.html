                Welcome to <i>PermLab</i>, the permutation laboratory. Feel
                free to press a button and dive in. The left hand button will
                allow you to build and explore the properties of individual
                permutations, while the right hand button will allow the 
                investigation of permutation classes.

                Although the code in this application is almost entirely written
                by me, many people have contributed to the development of <i>PermLab</i>
                over the last ten years including: Rhys Abraham, Mike Atkinson, 
                Michael Belton, Samson deJaeger and Chris Monteith.
