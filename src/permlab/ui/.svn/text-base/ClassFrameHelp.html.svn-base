            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The <i>class window</i> is the basic window for specifying a
            permutation class, and accessing its elements, enumeration, or
            an animated display.
            </p>
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>
                There are two text entry areas:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Basis</b></dt>
                <dd>A list of basis elements, or <i>avoided permutations</i> of
                    the class. These should be entered one per line with or
                    without whitespace (but not including commas). Thus, both
                    "123" and "1 2 3" are valid. For basis elements of length 10
                    or more, the whitespace version is required.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Length</b></dt>
                <dd>A specification of the lengths of permutations that are to
                    be constructed. This can be entered as a mix of ranges and
                    single values separated by commas, for instance "1, 3-6, 10".
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>The <b>Simples only</b> radio button restricts the permutations
                generated to be simple if selected. This is considerably more
                efficient than enumerating an entire class if only the simple
                permutations are of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three buttons that spawn a computation and display
                its results:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Enumerate</b></dt>
                <dd>Counts the permutations in the class of the given lengths.
                    Display can be as a table, or in simple text form according
                    to the choice made with the adjacent radio buttons.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>List</b></dt>
                <dd>Generates a list of all the permutations in the class of the
                    given lengths in a new window.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Animate</b></dt>
                <dd>Creates an animation window which displays all the permutation in the
                    class of the given lengths.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <h2>Stop!</h2>
            <p>
                All currently running computations can be stopped by using the <i>Stop</i>
                button. Such computations cannot be restarted.
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
